# Challenge - Image search (Unsplash API)

Using the free [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos) service, build a view that allows user to search for images (`GET /search/photos`) and display results in a paginated view.

Find Search endpoint documentation [here](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos).

**API credentials will be provided to you by email.**

### Frontend requirements:
- Input field for search query.
- Results view that display results in a grid.
- Results must be displayed using pagination / lazy loading.
- Any other features that you think is a **MUST** for great search experience, e.g. "No results found" view, sorting and etc.

### How to deliver the solution:
- Clone this project, setup your own GitHub repository and commit your code there.
- Make sure to include a README file with instructions on how to run the app.
- If it's a private repository, please add me as a collaborator (username: `gorilazish`).

> ### Notes
> - Free tier of Unsplash API has a rate limit of 50 requests per hour. You might want to save some mock responses while developing/testing.
> - It is up to you whether you want to put more focus on adding extensive list of features or making the app look and feel good with minimal functionality.
> - You can use any libraries or tools.
> - **We do not expect you to spend more than 8 hours on this task.**
> - Be prepared to explain your code and design decisions.
